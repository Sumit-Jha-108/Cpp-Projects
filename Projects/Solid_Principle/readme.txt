Concepts on SOLID PRINCIPLE

S - Single Responsibility PRINCIPLE
O - Open-Closed PRINCIPLE
L - Liskov Substitution PRINCIPLE
I - Interface Segmented PRINCIPLE
D - Dependency Inversion Principle

Advantages:
1. Help us to write better code.
2. Avoid duplicate code.
3. Easy to maintain.
4. Easy to understand.
5. Flexible software.
6. Reduce complexity.


Description:

1. Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.

2. Open-Closed Principle: Class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle: If class B is sub class of class A,then we should be able to 
replace object of B with A. Subclass should extend the behaviour of parent class and not narrow it down.

4. Interface Segmented Principle: Interface should be such that client should not implement unnecessary
functions they do not need.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle: class should depend on interface rather than concrete class.
